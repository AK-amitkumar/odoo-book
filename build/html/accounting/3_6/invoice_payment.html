  <p>In OpenERP, the invoicing workflow is very simple. You can see it in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/account_invoice_workflow.png"><img alt="../../_images/account_invoice_workflow.png" src="../../_images/account_invoice_workflow.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Invoicing Workflow</em></p>
</div>
<p>An invoice can be generated from various documents, such as a <cite>Sales Order</cite> and a <cite>Purchase Order</cite>, or at the time of confirming a shipment. These methods will be proposed when you use OpenERP as a truely integrated system.</p>
<p>Of course, companies often work together with an external accountant who keeps their books. In that case, you would like to know which invoices exist and have been paid.</p>
<p>The specific and easy-to-use <cite>Invoicing</cite> system in OpenERP allows you to keep track of your accounting, even when you are not an accountant.
It provides an easy way to follow up your suppliers and customers. You could use this simplified accounting in case you work with an (external) account to keep your books, and you still want to keep track of payments. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Invoicing</span></tt> system includes receipts and vouchers (an easy way to keep track of sales and purchases). It also offers you an easy method to register payments, without you having to encode complete abstracts of account.</p>
<div class="section" id="simple-customer-receipts">
<h1>Simple Customer Receipts<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-customer-receipts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When you sell products to a customer, you can give him a true invoice or a <cite>Sales Receipt</cite>, which is also called <cite>Customer Receipt</cite>.
Sales Receipts are merely a kind of sales ticket and not a real invoice.</p>
<p>When the sales receipt is confirmed, OpenERP creates journal items automatically and you can record the customer payment related to this sales receipt. The easy invoicing system does not require extensive accounting setup, so you will be up and running quickly!</p>
<p>You can create and modify a sales receipt from the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Customers ‣ Sales Receipt</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/account_sales_receipt.png"><img alt="../../_images/account_sales_receipt.png" src="../../_images/account_sales_receipt.png" style="width: 842.25px; height: 525.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Defining a Customer Receipt</em></p>
</div>
<p>When you create a new <cite>Sales Receipt</cite>, you have to enter the <cite>Customer</cite> for whom you want to create a voucher. You can also define <cite>Sales Lines</cite> in the <cite>Sales Information</cite> tab. Here you have to define <cite>Account</cite>, <cite>Amount</cite> and <cite>Description</cite>.
At the bottom of the form, you will have two options for <cite>Payment</cite>: one is <cite>Pay Directly</cite> and another is <cite>Pay Later or Group Funds</cite>.
When you select the <cite>Pay Directly</cite> option, you have to enter the bank <cite>Account</cite>. The <cite>Total</cite> amount displays automatically with calculation of tax (if you select VAT to be added) when you click the <cite>Compute Tax</cite> button.</p>
<p>When you purchase products from a supplier, you will receive a <cite>Purchase Receipt</cite> (a ticket),  which is also called <cite>Notes Payable</cite>
in accounting terminology. When a purchase receipt is confirmed, it creates journal items automatically and you can record
the supplier payment related to this purchase receipt, just like for the sales receipts.</p>
<p>You can create and modify the purchase receipt through the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Suppliers ‣ Purchase Receipt</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/account_purchase_receipt.png"><img alt="../../_images/account_purchase_receipt.png" src="../../_images/account_purchase_receipt.png" style="width: 839.25px; height: 458.25px;" /></a>

<p>The <cite>Purchase Receipt</cite> form looks like the <cite>Sales Receipt</cite> form. In this form, carefully select the journal.</p>

<div class="section" id="invoice-your-customers">
<h1>Invoice your Customers<a class="headerlink" href="#invoice-your-customers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It is surprising to see that in the 21st century, most companies still process quotations &amp; invoices manually, mostly by post or email. The trend is clearly for personal communication to disregard these legacy media, and replace them with instant messaging, social networks, etc. The <em>Electronic Data Interchange</em> (EDI) platform is here to try and open OpenERP to more modern communication systems, where electronic documents are exchanged and synchronised between business partners in real-time.</p>
<p>Initially, OpenERP will support a simple EDI mechanism for certain OpenERP documents, such as Sales Orders, Purchase Orders and Invoices.</p>
<p>Indeed, the integrated email and invoicing system in OpenERP allows you to create an invoice and automatically send an email with the invoice link to the customer.</p>
<p>The customer then has several options. If your customer also has an OpenERP instance, he can easily import the invoice you have sent him, simply by clicking the link.</p>
<p>Below, you find an example of such an EDI flow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Your company issues a Sales Order, a Purchase Order or an Invoice for a specific partner, let&#8217;s say Camptocamp.</li>
<li>Partner Camptocamp receives an email with a link to an online preview of the document.</li>
<li>In the online preview of the document, Camptocamp can read the document, download or print the PDF version, and then choose between a couple of options:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>import this document in his own OpenERP instance, simply by providing the instance address;</li>
<li>ask to create a new OpenERP online instance, where the document will be pre-imported;</li>
<li>ask for the raw EDI document, which the partner can then import in his own third-party software through a corresponding EDI import system.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Partner Camptocamp can also choose to directly pay online through Paypal or any other mechanism provided by your company.</li>
</ol>
<p>The email notification is freely customisable as an Email Template from the <em class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Technical ‣ Email ‣ Templates</em>.</p>
<p>To get the EDI and automatic emailing of orders and invoices to work, you need the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">EDI</span></tt> module, which is installed by default.
You need to add an email address to the partner and make sure the &#8220;Opt-out&#8221; checkbox is not selected. Ask your system administrator to configure an Outgoing Mail Server. Note that email notifications will be added to a mail queue and processed once in a while, but you can force emails to be send directly from the <em class="menuselection">Settings ‣ Technical ‣ Email ‣ Messages</em>.</p>
<p>The email your customer will receive, will look like the image displayed.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<h1>Keep Track of your Customer&#8217;s Payments<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-track-of-your-customer-s-payments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It is important to efficiently keep track of payments of your customers and suppliers. People who have no accounting knowledge and just want to use OpenERP to keep an eye on their payments, can set the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Invoicing</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">Payments</span></tt> access rights from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">User</span></tt> form.</p>
<p><em class="guilabel">Customer Payment</em> allows you to register the payments you receive from your customers.
In order to record a payment, you have to enter the customer, the payment method (= the journal) and the payment amount. OpenERP will automatically propose the reconciliation of this payment with any open invoices or sales receipts, credit notes and (advance) payments.</p>
<p>You can register Customer payments in OpenERP from the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Customers ‣ Customer Payment</em>; click <cite>Create</cite> to register a payment.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/account_customer_payment.png"><img alt="../../_images/account_customer_payment.png" src="../../_images/account_customer_payment.png" style="width: 838.5px; height: 476.25px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Customer Payment</em></p>
</div>
<p>Suppose you have an invoice of 3000 EUR; the amount you actually receive from the customer is 2995 EUR. You would consider the invoice as entirely paid. How would you proceed?</p>
<p>To create a new <cite>Customer Payment</cite>, select the customer, key in the <cite>Paid Amount</cite>, e.g. 2995 and select the <cite>Payment Method</cite>, i.e. your bank journal. Any open invoices, credit notes or advances for this partner will be displayed on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Payment</span> <span class="pre">Information</span></tt> tab.
In this example, the 3000 EUR invoice will be proposed.</p>
<p>Now you have to tell OpenERP that you want to consider the invoice as fully paid. Simply click the invoice line on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Payment</span> <span class="pre">Information</span></tt> tab to make it editable. Now select the <em class="guilabel">Full Reconcile</em> checkbox, and notice that the amount changes to the full amount of the invoice.</p>
<p>Select the proper option in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Payment</span> <span class="pre">Difference</span></tt> field, i.e. <cite>Reconcile Payment</cite> (you would use the <cite>Keep Open</cite> option if you want to claim the 5 EUR from the customer). The write-off amount is already proposed automatically, but you have to enter the <cite>Counterpart Account</cite> so that write-off entries can be generated by OpenERP. You can also enter a comment about the reconciliation (by default, Write-Off will be proposed). Then post your payment.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Analytic Accounts</p>
<p class="last">When you do analytic bookkeeping as well, you can enter an analytic account for the write-off too.</p>
</div>
<p>This easy payment system also allows you to post a payment that you cannot directly attribute to a customer as an advance.</p>
<p>Let us take the following example. A customer has two open invoices, one of 2000, one of 1500. He pays 1000, but you cannot assign this to any of the two invoices directly. You can just enter this payment as an advance. How do you proceed?</p>
<p>When you key in an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Amount</span> <span class="pre">paid</span></tt> of 1000 in your <cite>Customer Payment</cite>, the amount will be attributed to the oldest invoice. You do not want this, because you have no idea yet of what invoice the amount should be linked to. Click the amount in the first line and set it to 0.
Validate the payment. The system will now create an advance payment of 1000 for the customer concerned.</p>
<div class="admonition tip" id="index-0">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Supplier Payment</p>
<p class="last">The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Supplier</span> <span class="pre">Payment</span></tt> form allows you to track the payment to your suppliers in the same way as a customer payment.</p>
</div>
<p>From the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Suppliers ‣ Supplier Payment</em>, click the <cite>Create</cite> button to create a new <cite>Supplier Payment</cite>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/account_supplier_payment.png"><img alt="../../_images/account_supplier_payment.png" src="../../_images/account_supplier_payment.png" style="width: 675.0px; height: 421.5px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><em>Supplier Payment Form</em></p>
</div>
<p>Another way of keeping track of your payments is the way accountants will do it, by encoding <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Bank</span> <span class="pre">Statements</span></tt>. For more information about this, please refer to the chapter on <a class="reference internal" href="../3_7/invoices.html#invoicemanagement"><em>Advanced Invoice Management</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can also push your accounting further by importing your payments electronically through a CODA file you receive from the bank. To do this install the <tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">l10n_be_coda</span></tt> module.</p>
<p>How should you proceed?</p>
<p>You have to enter your company&#8217;s bank account(s) for which you want to accept CODA files. Go to the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Accounts ‣ Setup your Bank Accounts</em>. Choose the bank account type you want to use (IBAN or normal bank account). For electronic payments, you should use IBAN; do not forget to also enter your bank&#8217;s BIC code.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Bank Journal</p>
<p class="last">When you save the bank account through the Setup your Bank Accounts wizard, a bank journal will be automatically created for that account.</p>
</div>
<p>Then add the bank account details for each partner that will pay you through a bank. You can do this in the Partner form, on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Accounting</span></tt> tab.</p>
<p>Download the CODA file from your bank to any directory. Import the electronic bank statement through the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Bank and Cash ‣ Import CODA File</em>.</p>
<p>Enter the data required in the wizard . Then select the CODA file in your directory and click the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Import</span></tt> button to start processing the CODA file.</p>
<p>OpenERP will then import a draft bank statement in the selected journal and will match all corresponding customer / supplier payments when possible. You can change the draft statement if necessary from the menu <em class="menuselection">Accounting ‣ Bank and Cash ‣ Bank Statements</em>.</p>
