Install OpenERP on Fedora, CentOS
=================================

Once you install Fedora or CentOS desktop based client, you need to install PostgreSQL and few libraries that is required to run OpenERP.

Install PostgreSQL
------------------
You need to install PostgreSQL database as OpenERP is using as a backend storage, you need to install and configure before you setup additional libraries and OpenERP server.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql

After installing the packages, a database needs to be initialized and configured. To do this use Terminal (in fact, do not close current Terminal window during the installation process). First of all, log in as posgresql user using command

If you're not logged in as a root user, do it now, oherwise you won't be able to login as postgres user and type below commands to to initialize the database.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ su -
	$ su postgres
	$ initdb /var/lib/pgsql/data

Following commands will start PostgreSQL server and check for running PostgreSQL processes:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo service postgresql start

Check whether postgres is running or now and add postgresql service to startup list:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ps -eZ | grep postgres
	$ sudo chkconfig -level 235 postgresql on

:ref:`Install and configure PgAdmin3 <pgadmin3>` if you want to use graphical user interface for PostgreSQL.

Install OpenERP Server
----------------------
If you plan to use OpenERP 6.1 or above you need Python 2.6 or later version, simple like OpenERP's Versions policy its better to use the Fedora's last stable version for the Production Server.

On a Fedora or CentOS or rpm based Linux distribution you can install all required dependencies with this single command:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ sudo yum install python-devel pychart python-dateutil \
		python-reportlab python-lxml  python-psycopg2 python-mako \
		python-setuptools pytz PyYAML graphviz pydot python-imaging \
		pywebdav python-vobject vim system-config-firewall-tui \
		python-babel python-gdata python-ldap python-openid \
		python-werkzeug python-vatnumber

OpenERP server can be download form the OpenERP's website, check which version you should download. If you only want to test the server, you do not need to install it. Just unpack the archive and start the openerp-server executable:

.. code-block:: bash

	tar -xzf openerp-7.0-latest.tar.gz
	cd openerp-7.0-*
	./openerp-server
	./openerp-server -h
	
The OpenERP Server can be installed very easily using the setup.py file:

.. code-block:: bash

	tar -xzf openerp-7.0-latest.tar.gz
	cd openerp-7.0-*
	sudo python setup.py install

Once you install OpenERP successfully you are ready to Create your first database in OpenERP.

Setup Production Environment
----------------------------
After successfully setup the OpenERP Latest server, you can deploy OpenERP for production environment on Apache or gUnicorn based on your needs.
